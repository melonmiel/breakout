# Determine how you want to start learning based on your experience level! #

Follows are sections pertaining to your experience level as a
programer and experience level with coding in a dynamic language.

## If you have zero experience with programming. ##

If you have no programing experience at all. You'll want to take the
time to see what DragonRuby is like before jumping in to code. Watch
the following videos in order (each one is only ~20 minutes long).

Don't attempt to code anything shown in the video yet, just watch them to
get familiar with the language and how games are built.

## If you do not know Ruby, but have experience with C# (Unity) or GML (GameMaker) ##

Those engines rot your brain. Forget the concepts that the forced you
to learn. Game development is so much simpler than what they make you
do. Please, try your best to set aside the concepts those engines
teach (we promise our approach to game development is much much easier).

Watch these videos to get familiar with the Ruby language and
programming environment (they are ~20 min each so it'll be quick):

### STEP 1: Work through this Hello World tutorial ###

This tutorial is provided by Ryan C Gordon (check out his wikipedia
page). We call him "The Juggernaut":

Welcome!

Here's just a little push to get you started if you're new to programming or
game development.

If you want to write a game, it's no different than writing any other
program for any other framework: there are a few simple rules that might be
new to you, but more or less programming is programming no matter what you
are building.

Did you not know that? Did you think you couldn't write a game because you're
a "web guy" or you're writing Java at a desk job? Stop letting people tell
you that you can't, because you already have everything you need.

Here, we're going to be programming in a language called "Ruby." In the
interest of full disclosure, I (Ryan "The Juggernaut" Gordon) wrote the C
parts of this toolkit and Ruby looks a little strange to me (Amir Rajan wrote the
Ruby parts), but I'm going to walk you through the basics because we're all
learning together, and if you mostly think of yourself as someone that writes
C (or C++, C#, Objective-C), PHP, or Java, then you're only a step behind me right now.

Here's the most important thing you should know: Ruby lets you do some
complicated things really easily, and you can learn that stuff later. I'm
going to show you one or two cool tricks, but that's all.

Do you know what an if statement is? A for-loop? An array? That's all you'll
need to start.

Ok, here are few rules with regards to game development with GTK:

- Your game is all going to happen under one function...
- ...that runs 60 times a second...
- ...and has to tell the computer what to draw each time.

That's an entire video game in one run-on sentence.

Here's that function. You're going to want to put this in mygame/app/main.rb,
because that's where we'll look for it by default. Load it up in your favorite
text editor.

```ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels << [ 580, 400, 'Hello World!' ]
  end
```

Now run `dragonruby` ...did you get a window with "Hello World!" written in
it? Good, you're officially a game developer!

`mygame/app/main.rb`, is where the Ruby source code is located. This looks a little strange, so
I'll break it down line by line. In Ruby, a '#' character starts a single-line
comment, so I'll talk about this inline.

```ruby
  # This "def"ines a function, named "tick," which takes a single argument
  #  named "args". DragonRuby looks for this function and calls it every
  #  frame, 60 times a second. "args" is a magic structure with lots of
  #  information in it. You can set variables in there for your own game state,
  #  and every frame it will updated if keys are pressed, joysticks moved,
  #  mice clicked, etc.
  def tick args

    # One of the things in "args" is the "outputs" object that your game uses
    #  to draw things. Afraid of rendering APIs? No problem. In DragonRuby,
    #  you use arrays to draw things and we figure out the details.
    #  If you want to draw text on the screen, you give it an array (the thing
    #  in the [ brackets ]), with an X and Y coordinate and the text to draw.
    #  The "<<" thing says "append this array onto the list of them at
    #  args.outputs.labels)
    args.outputs.labels << [ 580, 400, 'Hello World!' ]
  end
```

Once your `tick` function finishes, we look at all the arrays you made and
figure out how to draw it. You don't need to know about graphics APIs.
You're just setting up some arrays! DragonRuby clears out these arrays
every frame, so you just need to add what you need _right now_ each time.

Now let's spice this up a little.

We're going to add some graphics. Each 2D image in DragonRuby is called a
"sprite," and to use them, you just make sure they exist in a reasonable file
format (png, jpg, gif, bmp, etc) and specify them by filename. The first time
you use one, DragonRuby will load it and keep it in video memory for fast
access in the future. If you use a filename that doesn't exist, you get a fun
checkerboard pattern!

There's a "dragonruby.png" file included, just to get you started. Let's have
it draw every frame with our text:

```ruby
  def tick args
    args.outputs.labels << [ 580, 400, 'Hello World!' ]
    args.outputs.sprites << [ 576, 100, 128, 101, 'dragonruby.png' ]
  end
```

(ProTip: you don't have to restart DragonRuby to test your changes; when you
save main.rb, DragonRuby will notice and reload your program.)

That `.sprites` line says "add a sprite to the list of sprites we're drawing,
and draw it at position (576, 100) at a size of 128x101 pixels". You can
find the image to draw at dragonruby.png.

Quick note about coordinates: (0, 0) is the bottom left corner of the screen,
and positive numbers go up and to the right. This is more "geometrically
correct," even if it's not how you remember doing 2D graphics, but we chose
this for a simpler reason: when you're making Super Mario Brothers and you
want Mario to jump, you should be able to add to Mario's y position as he
goes up and subtract as he falls. It makes things easier to understand.

Also: your game screen is _always_ 1280x720 pixels. If you resize the window,
we will scale and letterbox everything appropriately, so you never have to
worry about different resolutions.

Ok, now we have an image on the screen, let's animate it:

```ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.rotation ||= 0
    args.outputs.labels << [ 580, 400, 'Hello World!' ]
    args.outputs.sprites << [ 576, 100, 128, 101, 'dragonruby.png', args.state.rotation ]
    args.state.rotation -= 1
  end
```

Now you can see that this function is getting called a lot!

Here's a fun Ruby thing: `args.state.rotation ||= 0` is shorthand for "if
args.state.rotation isn't initialized, set it to zero." It's a nice way to
embed your initialization code right next to where you need the variable.

`args.state` is a place you can hang your own data and have it survive past the
life of the function call. In this case, the current rotation of our sprite,
which is happily spinning at 60 frames per second. If you don't specify
rotation (or alpha, or color modulation, or a source rectangle, etc),
DragonRuby picks a reasonable default, and the array is ordered by the most
likely things you need to tell us: position, size, name.

One thing we decided to do in DragonRuby is not make you worry about delta
time: your function runs at 60 frames per second (about 16 milliseconds) and
that's that. Having to worry about framerate is something massive triple-AAA
games do, but for fun little 2D games? You'd have to work really hard to not
hit 60fps. All your drawing is happening on a GPU designed to run Fortnite
quickly; it can definitely handle this.

Since we didn't make you worry about delta time, you can just move the
rotation by 1 every time and it works without you having to keep track of
time and math. Want it to move faster? Subtract 2.

Now, let's move that image around.

```ruby
  def tick args
    args.state.rotation ||= 0
    args.state.x ||= 576
    args.state.y ||= 100

    if args.inputs.mouse.click
      args.state.x = args.inputs.mouse.click.point.x - 64
      args.state.y = args.inputs.mouse.click.point.y - 50
    end

    args.outputs.labels << [ 580, 400, 'Hello World!' ]
    args.outputs.sprites << [ args.state.x, args.state.y, 128, 101, 'dragonruby.png', args.state.rotation ]

    args.state.rotation -= 1
  end
```

Everywhere you click your mouse, the image moves there. We set a default
location for it with args.state.x ||= 576, and then we change those variables
when we see the mouse button in action. You can get at the keyboard and game
controllers in similar ways.

There is a lot more you can do with DragonRuby, but now you've already got
just about everything you need to make a simple game. After all, even the
most fancy games are just creating objects and moving them around. Experiment
a little. Add a few more things and have them interact in small ways. Want
something to go away? Just don't add it to args.output anymore.

### STEP 2: Read the CHEATSHEET.txt ###

Go to the file CHEATSHEET.txt and skim through it quickly to get a
feel for some of the other APIs you have access to. If you need even
more details you'll find them at `mygame/documentation`.

### STEP 3: Run each sample app in order and read the code. ###

The sample apps located in the `sample` directory are ordered by
increasing complexity. Run each one of them and read through the
code. Play around by changing values and see how they change the game.

### STEP 4: Editor integration. ###

There is a file called `vim-ctags` and `emacs-ctags`. The data in
these files are standard output provided by Exuberent CTAGS. Most
editors have a "ctags plugin" so just search for that plugin for your
editor and point it to these files.

### STEP 5: Get in the habit of reading the CHANGELOG ##

We are constantly adding new features to the engine. Be sure to read
the changelog with every release.

# How to publish your game.

Once you've built your game, you're all set to deploy! Good luck in
your game dev journey and if you get stuck, come to the Discord
channel!

## STEP 1: Create a new Game in Itch.io. ##

Log into Itch.io and go to https://itch.io/game/new.

   - Title: Give your game a Title. This value represents your `gametitle`.
   - Project URL: Set your project url. This value represents your `gameid`.
   - Classification: Keep this as Game.
   - Kind of Project: Select HTML from the drop down list. Dont worry,
     the HTML project type _aslo supports binary downloads_.
   - Uploads: Skip this section for now.

You can fill out all the other options later.

## STEP 2: Go to mygame/metadata/metadata.txt and update it. ##

Point your text editor at mygame/metadata/game_metadata.txt and
make it look like this: (Remove the `#` at the beginning of each line).

```
devid=bob
devtitle=Bob The Game Developer
gameid=mygame
gametitle=My Game
version=0.1
```

The `devid` property is the username you use to log into Itch.io.
The `devtitle` is your name or company name (it can contain spaces).
The `gameid` is the Project URL value (see details in STEP 1).
The `gametitle` is the name of your game (it can contain spaces).
The `version` can be any `major.minor` number format.

## STEP 3: Build your game for distribution. ##

Open up the terminal and run this from the command line:

```ruby
./dragonruby-publish --only-package mygame
```

(if you're on Windows, don't put the "./" on the front. That's a Mac and
Linux thing.)

A directory called `./build` will be created that contains your
binaries. You can upload this to Itch.io manually. For the HTML
version of your game after you upload it. Check the checkbox labeled
"This file will be played in the browser".

For subsequent updates you can use an automated deployment to Itch.io:

```
./dragonruby-publish mygame
```

DragonRuby will package _and publish_ your game to itch.io! Tell your
friends to go to your game's very own webpage and buy it!

If you make changes to your game, just re-run dragonruby-publish and it'll
update the downloads for you.
